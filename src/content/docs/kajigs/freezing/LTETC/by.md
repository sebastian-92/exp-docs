BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGED.

1. Follow step one of the original instructions to find a page belonging to the Chrome extension you want to disable.
2. Visit that `chrome-extension://extension_id_here` page, then type `chrome://hang` in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.
3. Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don't close anything.
4. Go to the `chrome://extensions` page for the blocker extension you want to Disable.
5. If that page has any switch, such as `Allow access to file URLs`, click that switch. If you don't see any clickable switches, this exploit will not work
6. The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now.
