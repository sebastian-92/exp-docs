# LTMEAT Print *Freeze extensions*

1. Find your extension's largest file. This can usually be found by using [Rob Wu's crxviewer](https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/)
2. Go to that page and run `Ctrl`+`P`. A print window should show up, with several pages in the top right.
3. Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, change layout to landscape, anything you can. The higher you get that number, the longer the effect will last.
4. Reload. The page should start hanging.
5. Go to your extension's settings page, `chrome://extensions`.
6. Duplicate your "printing" tab, and go back to your extension's settings page.
7. Flip any switch you can find there. Usually, there'll be one titled `Allow access to file URLs`.
