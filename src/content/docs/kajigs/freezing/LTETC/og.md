**L**iterally **T**he **M**eatiest **E**xploit of **A**ll **T**ime

1. Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. `chrome://extensions`, `chrome://extensions-internals`, and `chrome://process-internals` are all good places to find your extension's ID (a 32-character lowercase string). You can also do a simple Google search. Once you have your ID, substitute it into the hostname in the URL below:

```
chrome-extension://extensionidhereblahblah/manifest.json
```

For some filters like Securly, the block screen is already an extension page. 

2. Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark `chrome://kill` (B) and `chrome://hang` (C). 
3. On the extension page (A), click the `chrome://kill` bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared. 
4. Instantly start spamming `chrome://hang` (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming (ideally with the refresh key on your keyboard or `ctrl`+`R`). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page. 
5. If the extension page (bookmark A) no longer loads, then LTMEAT worked! You can close your tabs, and the extension will be dead. If nothing loads, you probably reloaded too late or spammed too slowly. This isn't rocket science! Restart your computer to revert back to normal.
